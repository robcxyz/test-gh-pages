Nukikata: Cookiecutter Fork
======================================

Cookiecutter creates projects from project templates, e.g. Python package projects.

Nukikata extends this functionality to include a plugins based system of operators
with conditionals and loops. With these new options, users can now create modular
user journeys connecting a web of declarative CLIs.
